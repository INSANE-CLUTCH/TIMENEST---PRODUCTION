    "content": "In our fast-paced world — when every moment seems to be filled with more tasks than time allows — time management isn’t just a nice-to-have skill; it’s a critical lifeline for both professional success and personal fulfillment.\nThe pressures of modern work are creating more unproductive noise for employees than ever. According to Slack’s latest State of Work report, 43% of employees find it hard to stay motivated, and 29% have difficulty keeping their focus. Meanwhile, 71% of business leaders are feeling the pressure to squeeze even more productivity out of their teams.\nFrom using AI to automating routine tasks, here are 11 top tips for time better management.\nWhat is time management?\nTime management involves planning how to efficiently use and deliberately control the time you spend to maximize productivity. In short, time management helps you get more done in less time. Other upsides include:\nWhy is time management important?\nAn effective time management strategy can make your workday more efficient and effective. Check out these time management tips to help transform your work.\nExpert advice on how to better manage your time\nHere’s how to get started designing a better time management routine.\n1. Know how you’re spending your time\nIf your productivity is measured by output over a certain period, lost time can mean dollars out the window. Just like creating a budget, you have to track what you’re actually spending your time on to reveal any areas or habits that are blocking you from reaching your goals.\nStart with a time check. Time-tracking tools such as Harvest and TrackingTime can integrate directly into your Slack workspace, and they can tell you, based on the categories you set up, how many hours you’re productive in a day versus how much time you’re spending on non-work-related activities, such as browsing social media or shopping.\n2. Stick to a daily schedule\nGo beyond “I have eight hours to do XYZ.” Create a daily schedule with allotted time blocks for different tasks. Sticking to it is the key to success.\n3. Prioritize\nTo-do lists can be productivity lifesavers. But if you’re not careful, they can get so big and overwhelming that you don’t know where to start. A tool known as the Eisenhower Matrix can help you decide what to prioritize according to importance and urgency. Using this decision matrix, you can break down your list by:\n4. Automate repetitive tasks\nEmployees who automate are 71% more likely to exceed managers’ expectations, as we learned in the State of Work report. When you automate tedious or repetitive work, it can free up valuable time, allowing you to focus on more complex and creative aspects of your work.\nWith tools like Slack’s Workflow Builder, you can create automations that are as simple or as complex as you’d like. They can even be connected to the other apps and services you use to get work done. And because no coding skills are necessary, anyone, regardless of their technical background, can deploy automations with just a few clicks.\n5. Tackle the most difficult task first\nDistractions happen to all of us, whether it’s a phone call, a favor from a colleague or that pile of dirty dishes. Next thing you know, the day is gone. It’s time to “eat that frog.”\nThe Eat That Frog productivity method devised by leadership expert Brian Tracy works well for people who tend to procrastinate or have trouble avoiding distractions. It recommends tackling the biggest, most difficult and most important task first — the one you’re likely to put off for later. Only move on to other things once you’ve “eaten that frog.”\n5. Batch-process similar tasks\nBatching, or batch processing, means grouping similar tasks so you can work on them together. Group them by objective or function.\nFor example:\n6. Put AI to work for search and summaries\nImagine having an assistant that cuts through the noise, giving you just the information you need, when you need it. Artificial intelligence boosts your productivity by answering your questions, summarizing conversations and creating content like sales pitches and blog outlines. It helps you find relevant information quickly, focus on important tasks and manage your time better so you can get more done.\n7. Set reasonable time limits\nParkinson’s law states that, “Work expands to fill the time allotted to complete it.”\nIf you have a full day to complete two tasks that should take only three hours, you’ll probably still spend the whole day on those two tasks. If you give yourself a smaller window, chances are you’ll still meet the earlier deadline.\n8. Learn when to say no\nWe have only so much energy in a day, and it wanes with the hours. To avoid half-baked work, know your limits and be willing to say no. Recognize your strengths and weaknesses. Focus on what you’re good at and, if possible, delegate what can be done better and faster by other people.\n9. Avoid multitasking\nThe science is clear on multitasking: It cuts efficiency and can even be dangerous. According to the American Psychological Association, mental juggling involves “switching costs” that slash productivity. Although task switching might cost only a few seconds per switch, it adds up if you multitask frequently. Your risk for error also soars.\n10. Keep things organized\nYou might need an organization makeover if any of these have happened to you:\nThe good news is that organization is a skill that can be learned. Start with the basics.\nMaster time management to boost productivity\nYou can also leverage these productivity and automation tools designed to boost productivity:\nMost high-performing teams have figured out how to maximize their time. Take back your workday with these time management best practices, and get your productivity up and stress levels down."
